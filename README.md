# GPDB-scripts

This is a collection of Korn Shell and Python scripts I wrote while I was a Greenplum Solution Architect working for EMC and later Pivotal.  Mostly tools to identify and clean up dirty data, which was a common issue in most POCs that I worked on.

These scripts were meant to work on Greenplum Database, but many of them are just generic scripts to identify and remove bad rows in order to get 95-98% of data successfully loaded into the system, which is normally good enough to prove out concepts in a time-boxed engagement.
